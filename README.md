## 📖 Introduction
The **IPL Victory Predictor** is a highly advanced, dual-engine machine learning dashboard built to forecast the trajectory and final outcome of IPL matches in **real-time**. Backed by comprehensive ball-by-ball datasets from **2008 to 2025**, the system provides predictive insight throughout both innings—calculating expected targets dynamically in the 1st Innings, and shifting gears to calculate robust Win Probabilities during the 2nd Innings chase.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### **1. First-Innings Expected Score Engine**
- **Dynamic Phased Architecture**: Utilizes three completely independent regression systems optimized specifically for the phase of the game (**Powerplay**, **Middle**, and **Death Overs**).
- **Intelligent Bounding**: Analyzes venue stat-base, batting strength, and real-time momentum to output exceptionally stable **Safety-Bounded Expected Target Ranges**, backed by a dynamically calculated confidence tier based on real historical Mean Absolute Errors.

### **2. Second-Innings Win Probability Engine**
- **Ensemble Powerhouse**: Combines **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** into a Soft-Voting Ensemble trained on over 120,000 unique chase scenarios. 
- **What-If Sandbox**: Run tactical sandbox analyses by dragging sliders (What if the chasing team loses 2 wickets in the next 10 balls? How does the win percentage plummet?).

### **3. Live API Synchronization**
- Forget manually entering data. The dashboard hooks up specifically with the **CricketData.org Live Match API** to fetch ongoing global scores, targets, active teams, and metadata completely instantly, automatically parsing the exact state into the machine learning pipelines.
- Implements robust error-handling protecting the UI smoothly against hit-limits or server disconnects.

### **4. Premium "Glassmorphism" UI**
- Dumps generic data styling for a polished, blur-heavy aesthetic.
- The UI mimics broadcast-tier visual fidelity including responsive Scorecard components, ordinal date formatting, and beautifully categorized model commentary.

## 🔧 Installation & Local Deployment

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaWadkar/IPL-Winner-Predictor.git
   cd IPL-Winner-Predictor
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   The `CricketData.org` API requires a key. 
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Paste your free access key: `API_KEY=your_key_here`.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # (On Windows use: .\venv\Scripts\activate)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Application**:
   Simply spin up the Streamlit engine!
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

*(Note: If you wish to retrain the models from scratch, download the massive Kaggle Database mapping 2008-2025, place it in the `data/` folder, and individually trigger the generation files located inside `scripts/`.)*
